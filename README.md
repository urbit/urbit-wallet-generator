# wallet-generator

A user-friendly client-side app for generating Urbit HD wallets.

## Install

Pull down dependencies via:

```
$ npm install
```

Note that for the time being you'll need read access to two private
repositories, namely `sigil-js` and `PaperCollateralRenderer`.

## Build

You can use `npm run-script build` to execute the gulpfile.  `npm run-script
release` will prepare a release and corresponding checksum in `./dist`.
