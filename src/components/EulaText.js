    {`Software Overview. The Software is an interface that you can use to generate a
    hierarchical deterministic wallet that enables the creation of child keys from
    parent keys in a hierarchy (“Wallet”).  Those keys can be private keys or can
    involve a public Ethereum Wallet address that can be used to send and receive
    Urbit address space in transactions with third parties (such private keys and
    public addresses, the “Keys”). The Software may only be used if you are
    disconnected from the internet and will automatically close if it detects an
    internet connection. Tlon recommends that you use the Software only on an
    airgapped machine.`}

    NO ADVICE OR INFORMATION, WHETHER ORAL OR WRITTEN, OBTAINED BY YOU FROM THE

    <p>
    TO THE FULLEST EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW, IN NO EVENT WILL THE TLON ENTITIES BE
    LIABLE TO YOU FOR ANY INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL, SPECIAL, CONSEQUENTIAL OR PUNITIVE

    TO THE FULLEST EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW AND EXCEPT AS OTHERWISE SET FORTH IN

    DISCLAIMER OF WARRANTIES, OR EXCLUSION OF DAMAGES IS INTENDED TO AND DOES
    ALLOCATE THE RISKS BETWEEN THE PARTIES UNDER THESE TERMS. THIS ALLOCATION IS AN
    ESSENTIAL ELEMENT OF THE BASIS OF THE BARGAIN BETWEEN THE PARTIES. EACH OF
    THESE PROVISIONS IS SEVERABLE AND INDEPENDENT OF ALL OTHER PROVISIONS OF THESE
    TERMS. THE LIMITATIONS IN THIS SECTION 10 WILL APPLY EVEN IF ANY LIMITED REMEDY
    FAILS OF ITS ESSENTIAL PURPOSE.
    </p>
    <p>
    Dispute Resolution and Arbitration
    </p>
    <p>
    Generally. In the interest of resolving disputes between you and Tlon in the
    most expedient and cost effective manner, and except as described in Section
    11.2, you and Tlon agree that every dispute arising in connection with these
    Terms will be resolved by binding arbitration. Arbitration is less formal than
    a lawsuit in court. Arbitration uses a neutral arbitrator instead of a judge or
    jury, may allow for more limited discovery than in court, and can be subject to
    very limited review by courts. Arbitrators can award the same damages and
    relief that a court can award. This agreement to arbitrate disputes includes
    all claims arising out of or relating to any aspect of these Terms, whether
    based in contract, tort, statute, fraud, misrepresentation, or any other legal
    theory, and regardless of whether a claim arises during or after the
    termination of these Terms. YOU UNDERSTAND AND AGREE THAT, BY ENTERING INTO
    THESE TERMS, YOU AND Tlon ARE EACH WAIVING THE RIGHT TO A TRIAL BY JURY OR TO
    PARTICIPATE IN A CLASS ACTION.
    </p>
    <p>
    Exceptions. Despite the provisions of Section 11.1, nothing in these Terms will
    be deemed to waive, preclude, or otherwise limit the right of either party to:
    (a) bring an individual action in small claims court; (b) pursue an enforcement
    action through the applicable federal, state, or local agency if that action is
    available; (c) seek injunctive relief in a court of law in aid of arbitration;
    or (d) to file suit in a court of law to address an intellectual property
    infringement claim.
    </p>
    <p>
    Arbitrator. Any arbitration between you and Tlon will be settled under the
    Federal Arbitration Act and administered by the American Arbitration
    Association (“AAA”) under its Consumer Arbitration Rules (collectively, “AAA
    Rules”) as modified by these Terms. The AAA Rules and filing forms are
    available online at www.adr.org, by calling the AAA at 1-800-778-7879, or by
    contacting Tlon. The arbitrator has exclusive authority to resolve any dispute
    relating to the interpretation, applicability, or enforceability of this
    binding arbitration agreement.
    </p>
    <p>
    Notice of Arbitration; Process. A party who intends to seek arbitration must
    first send a written notice of the dispute to the other party by certified U.S.
    Mail or by Federal Express (signature required) or, only if that other party
    has not provided a current physical address, then by electronic mail (“Notice
    of Arbitration”). Tlon’s address for Notice is: Tlon Corporation, [Company
    Postal Address]. The Notice of Arbitration must: (a) describe the nature and
    basis of the claim or dispute; and (b) set forth the specific relief sought
    (“Demand”). The parties will make good faith efforts to resolve the claim
    directly, but if the parties do not reach an agreement to do so within 30 days
    after the Notice of Arbitration is received, you or Tlon may commence an
    arbitration proceeding. All arbitration proceedings between the parties will be
    confidential unless otherwise agreed by the parties in writing. During the
    arbitration, the amount of any settlement offer made by you or Tlon must not be
    disclosed to the arbitrator until after the arbitrator makes a final decision
    and award, if any. If the arbitrator awards you an amount higher than the last
    written settlement amount offered by Tlon in settlement of the dispute prior to
    the award, Tlon will pay to you the higher of: (i) the amount awarded by the
    arbitrator; or (ii) $10,000.
    </p>
    <p>
    Fees. If you commence arbitration in accordance with these Terms, Tlon will
    reimburse you for your payment of the filing fee, unless your claim is for more
    than $10,000, in which case the payment of any fees will be decided by the AAA
    Rules. Any arbitration hearing will take place at a location to be agreed upon
    in San Francisco County, California, but if the claim is for $10,000 or less,
    you may choose whether the arbitration will be conducted: (a) solely on the
    basis of documents submitted to the arbitrator; (b) through a non-appearance
    based telephone hearing; or (c) by an in-person hearing as established by the
    AAA Rules in the county (or parish) of your billing address. If the arbitrator
    finds that either the substance of your claim or the relief sought in the
    Demand is frivolous or brought for an improper purpose (as measured by the
    standards set forth in Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 11(b)), then the payment
    of all fees will be governed by the AAA Rules. In that case, you agree to
    reimburse Tlon for all monies previously disbursed by it that are otherwise
    your obligation to pay under the AAA Rules. Regardless of the manner in which
    the arbitration is conducted, the arbitrator must issue a reasoned written
    decision sufficient to explain the essential findings and conclusions on which
    the decision and award, if any, are based. The arbitrator may make rulings and
    resolve disputes as to the payment and reimbursement of fees or expenses at any
    time during the proceeding and upon request from either party made within 14
    days of the arbitrator’s ruling on the merits.
    </p>
    <p>
    No Class Actions. YOU AND TLON AGREE THAT EACH MAY BRING CLAIMS AGAINST THE
    OTHER ONLY IN YOUR OR ITS INDIVIDUAL CAPACITY AND NOT AS A PLAINTIFF OR CLASS
    MEMBER IN ANY PURPORTED CLASS OR REPRESENTATIVE PROCEEDING. Further, unless
    both you and Tlon agree otherwise, the arbitrator may not consolidate more than
    one person’s claims, and may not otherwise preside over any form of a
    representative or class proceeding.
    </p>
    <p>
    Modifications to this Arbitration Provision. If Tlon makes any future change to
    this arbitration provision, other than a change to Tlon’s address for Notice of
    Arbitration, you may reject the change by sending us written notice within 30
    days of the change to Tlon’s address for Notice of Arbitration, in which case
    your account with Tlon will be immediately terminated and this arbitration
    provision, as in effect immediately prior to the changes you rejected will
    survive.
    </p>
    <p>
    Enforceability. If Section 11.6 is found to be unenforceable or if the entirety
    of this Section 11 is found to be unenforceable, then the entirety of this
    Section 11 will be null and void and, in that case, the parties agree that the
    exclusive jurisdiction and venue described in Section 12 will govern any action
    arising out of or related to these Terms.
    </p>
    <p>
    Miscellaneous. Your use of the Software is subject to all additional terms,
    policies, rules, or guidelines applicable to the Software or certain features
    of the Software that we may post on or link to from the Software (the
    “Additional Terms”). All Additional Terms are incorporated by this reference
    into, and made a part of, these Terms. You may not assign or transfer these
    Terms or your rights under these Terms, in whole or in part, by operation of
    law or otherwise, without our prior written consent. We may assign these Terms
    at any time without notice or consent. The failure to require performance of
    any provision will not affect our right to require performance at any other
    time after that, nor will a waiver by us of any breach or default of these
    Terms, or any provision of these Terms, be a waiver of any subsequent breach or
    default or a waiver of the provision itself. If any part of these Terms is held
    to be invalid or unenforceable, the unenforceable part will be given effect to
    the greatest extent possible, and the remaining parts will remain in full force
    and effect.  These Terms are governed by the laws of the State of California
    without regard to conflict of law principles. You and Tlon submit to the
    personal and exclusive jurisdiction of the state courts and federal courts
    located within San Francisco County, California for resolution of any lawsuit
    or court proceeding permitted under these Terms. We are under no obligation to
    provide support for the Software. In instances where we may offer support, the
    support will be subject to published policies.
